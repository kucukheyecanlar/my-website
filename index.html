        <p>
            Hi! My name is Furkan, and I’m a 19-year-old Computer Science student from Turkey. I have a deep passion for technology and am currently on a journey to learn software development. This is my first website, and I’m incredibly excited to explore the world of web development. Aside from coding, I enjoy staying active with sports, listening to music, and singing in my free time.

            Traveling is one of my biggest passions—I love discovering new places, trying different foods, and experiencing new cultures. I’m also a very social person who enjoys spending quality time with friends and meeting new people. Personal growth is important to me, and I’m always looking for new ways to improve myself. Thanks for stopping by my website, and I hope you enjoy your visit!
